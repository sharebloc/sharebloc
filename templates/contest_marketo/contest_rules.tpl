                <p>Thanks for participating in The Content Marketing Nation Contest. Here are three simple rules:
                <div class="contest_rules_subcontent">
                    <p><span class="contest_rules_subheader">1. Submit only the best content that exemplifies marketing automation, and it doesn't have to be yours.</span><br>
                    ShareBloc is about finding the best content, especiallly if it isn't yours. Please take some time to find the best content and we're confident it'll make its way to the top!
                    <p><span class="contest_rules_subheader">2. Do not spam the contest.</span><br>
                    We have <a href="/guidelines/" target="_blank">ShareBloc etiquette</a> that we hope you follow. If you spam the site, we will delete your posts, or possibly suspend your account. If you try to game the contest with multiple fake accounts on a poor quality post, we will delete the post, or possibly suspend your account.
                    <p><span class="contest_rules_subheader">3. Our representatives will help curate.</span><br>
                    We have enlisted some of the leading marketing automation experts from LeadMD (our main sponsor), Infer, Heinz Marketing, Cloudwords and Ringlead to help curate the content.
                    <p>Each of the representatives will have ten votes a day (instead of three) and will help choose the winners. These representatives or anyone from their respective companies and family are not eligible to win so there should be no conflict of interest.
                </div>
                <p>Contest winners will be notified no later than April 1. For more legal information on the contest, see <a href="/sharebloc_content_marketing_nation_contest_rules" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <p>We do recommend you share this contest on Twitter and in social media, especially if your content is great. Thanks!
