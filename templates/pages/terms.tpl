            <div class="legal_subheader">C.  ShareBloc Accounts</div>

            Your ShareBloc account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.   We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users.  If you open a ShareBloc account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) &#34;you&#34; includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity&#39;s behalf.  By connecting to ShareBloc with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.

            <p>You may never use another User&#39;s account without permission.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.  You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.

You must notify ShareBloc immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.  ShareBloc will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            For any dispute with ShareBloc, you agree to first contact us at arbitration@sharebloc.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  In the unlikely event that ShareBloc has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any ShareBloc claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, &#34;Claims&#34;), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (&#34;AAA&#34;) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, unless you and ShareBloc agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.   Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party&#39;s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&#39; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SHAREBLOC ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
