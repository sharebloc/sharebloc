                <div class="resource_bio">When youâ€™re chasing down a sale, you are probably selling against a competitor. While sales is not nearly as dramatic as the space race, landing a big customer could make you feel over the moon. We identified 40 enterprise vendors that help sales people better close their leads. There are three major tools sales people can use (analytics, presentation, closing) and all those tools should tie into your CRM platform.

                <div class="resource_bio">Lead generation is a process. Like a crop, you can&rsquo;t just acquire a raw lead and bring it to market. Leads have to be nurtured over time before they can be properly harvested. We identified 40 enterprise vendors that help marketers better farm their leads. There are three main stages of lead farming: Planting a Lead, Nurturing a Lead and Harvesting a Lead.

                <div class="resource_bio">There are three main &quot;strategies&quot; to get your startup&rsquo;s back-office up and running quickly.  It&rsquo;s a fair assumption that the more you pay, the less you have to manage (and see), which has its pros and cons.  On one hand, you don&rsquo;t have to deal with the non-core but critical functions associated with HR.  On the other, you also pay a premium by not maximizing each function through a variety of vendors.  There are no wrong answers, just different preferences based on your company&rsquo;s needs, bandwidth and resources.

                <div class="resource_bio">We compiled this list after interviewing around 100 startup founders from around the world. The startups ranged greatly: some had 2 to 200+ person headcounts; others were in the consumer internet to medtech device spaces; we had startups from San Francisco to New York to London.  Our objective is to provide enterprise founders, executives, product managers, engineers, and looky-loos a quick cheat sheet on what vendors their peers have chosen with their budgets.
